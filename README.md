# RIDE
Retainment Interval Dose Escalation Design

These R programs facilitate implementing the RIDE design and replicating the simulation studies reported in the corresponding manuscript.

ride-functions.R contains the R functions for implementing the RIDE design

comparator-functions.R contains the R functions for implementing the comparator designs, i.e. CRM, mTPI, and BOIN

The remaining files 'source' the above files, so the above files just need to be placed in the working directory of the R session. 

tables1+2.R facilitates replication of Tables 1 and 2 in the manuscript.

classic-simulation.R facilitates replication of the classic simulation study in the manuscript.

contemporary-simulation.R facilitates replication of the contemporary simulation study in the manuscript.
